This is the code base for the Tweetify React app which is simply a twitter clone that I have built. The Backend is built using an public api which helps in functionality like posting a tweet, sending notifs, uploading profile pictures etc.

Technologies used - 
React, Redux, NoSQL, Node.js(Express.js), Material-UI library and many other smaller libraries.
